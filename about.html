        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I was raised in Siskiyou County where I spent most of my time outdoors playing sports, fishing, hiking, etc. 
            Although I have always been good with computers, it wasn't until I moved to Southern California and began spending more time
            indoors that I really developed my interest for scripting and coding. A friend of mine asked me to build him an excel spreadsheet
            which ended up requiring more than excel's build-in functions. So, I began teaching myself how to code in VBA. From there, I 
            enrolled in a programming class to learn C+. Upon completion of this class, I knew that I wanted to pursue my career in coding.<br>

            I then decided to enroll in ITT Technical Institute in the hope of obtaining my Bachelor's degree. When the school shut down,
            I immediately began looking for alternative programs. That's when I recieved the email from West Hills College about the Bitwise 
            Internship. Although this internship was for web developement (which I had never studied up until this point), I decided to give it a 
            try. I knew I had to learn the basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages in order to be successful, so I began teaching myself how to code 
            in these languages. Now, several weeks into the program, I have learned much more than I imagined I could in this short amount of time.
