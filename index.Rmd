# About Me {.main-heading}
<p>
I am a Computer Science student at California State University Chico. I am currently minoring in math, and going for my certificate in Data Science Certificate as well. My strengths and interests are split into three categories: Artificial Intelligence, Application Development, and Data Science.  
In addition, I have received my certificate in Responsive Web Design, and have created several websites throughout this process.  
This is my personal website to host my major projects.
