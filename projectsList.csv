Data Science Project	https://introdsci.github.io/DataScience-kcrisci94/index	This project uses a collection of measurements on harmful particles in the atmosphere at several different locations in California. It uses this data to determine which geographic locations have the highest levels of air pollution. It then uses populations in those general regions to determine if population has an affect on the air pollution levels.
